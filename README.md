# InventoryApp

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  This is supposed to be an inventory app, designed to keep track of a user's inventory while sending them notifications if an items runs out. It is supposed to include two tables for storing login info seperate from the inventory list, a login page, a table for displaying the inventory list, and the ability to increase/decrease and add/delete items on the list. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  With keeping the users in mind, I focused on making sure the UI was clean, pleasant, and organized, while also making sure the app intuitively flowed from one screen to the next. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  I first focused on getting the pages in the proper hierachy and linked to each other properly. Then I worked out the logic of each button and widget individually, completing each feature before moving on to the next feature. Projects work best when taken slowly, one chunk at a time. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  Testing included running the application and seeing if the newly implemented feature works the way I intended and did not mess up the workings of previously created features. 
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  I particularly enjoyed the UI design step in developing this application. It came much more naturally than the code logic did, and I believe I was able to demonstrate this in the project previews.
